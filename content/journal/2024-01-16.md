Nothing much is going on, I posted on Reddit that I am going to make a website for the martyred journalists of Gaza. I got pretty good response, It will be a long project, i will make the skeleton, then start filling out data. 

There is a slight learning curve but, I think I will learn something in the process. 

So, to achieve what I am aiming for, I would have to make a generator in jekyll first which will generate pages of each journalists when clicked on a link. I can make it the hard way, like making page for each individual, but it would be very time taking and if unfortunately i'd have to make a change in the template then i'd have to go through every single page to change it. 

To save time and energy, i'd learn to make the generator and then put the data in.
