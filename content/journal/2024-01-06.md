### Not actually what you call a journal entry ðŸ˜¬, but this is the story thus far 

- actually this is the journal entry of 7th of Jan but the date is 6th because when i am writing this, for some weird reason the `hugo site generator` thinks that it is not yet seventh and the post has a future date so it ignores it. 
- thus the date 6th, just for the sake of testing things. 
- however, news 
	- I removed tailwind from this site, meanwhile I think it is a great framework, I love how easy it makes everything, just enter a classname and you have css styles right there. However, I don't think it is made for small projects like this and it is a little bit hard to manage as well. 
	- so, unless for a bigger project, I think I will have to stop using tailwind. 


- **Obsidian is coming out great**
- Here's a little story - 
	- first I had chosen logseq (another knowledge management application) for the job because it comes with built-in journal writing mechanism.
	- but later found it unusable.
	- I knew that it came with the *bulleting system*, meaning that it created a bullet point automatically on a new line which is ridiculous. 
	- since I need to have front matter in every page which is necessary for the page to appear to Hugo as page. 
	- so front matter looks something like this 

	 ```
	 ---
	 title: title of the page
	 date: 2024-01-06
	 ---
	 ```


	- but with every new line starting with a bullet like this "&bull;" or in markdown language like this "-" it was impossible to create a front matter. 
	- However, you can hide the bullet points temporarily, but it was a headache because it will automatically be re-enabled after you start the application again. 
	- I could adjust with writing journals in bullet points like I am doing it now but the front matter thing really made logseq unusable, though it is a great application. 
	- So, I had to check back to obsidian, it has a plugin called `daily-notes` which makes it able to write daily journal with automatic titles which is the date. 
	- with obsidian I can create front matter with easy and another feature which was unknown to me was that obsidian notes also have front matter and it works in same manner it work in SSGs, but it beautifies it and makes it really fancy.

	- you can see how it created entries like title and date and it gives you choice to add more properties. It calls front matter properties. 
	- It's just great, I love how streamline it makes, you literally have to write no code, you write your journal and commit the change and voila you have your journal entry. 
- I don't think many people know this or had this idea. I think I am going to share this over to Reddit and see how people react to it.
