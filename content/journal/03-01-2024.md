So, finally I have changed the previous theme which was custom made from scratch. I have added Tailwind CSS. I don't know how tailwind works so I am learning along the way as well. 


Got most of the things working so far which is looking good I guess. I'm afraid more groundbreaking changes do not look kindly upon this site hereafter, however, the hope of having minor improvement should not feel dejected. 


Well, good people that was all for today. Go eat something you look hungry. I will see you soon.
